# LaPajitaHackaton
The aim of this project is to develop a dynamic waiting list system to control the amount of people that they can attend properly. The places that activate the waiting list will allow customers to subscribe to the list. 
ISDI Hackathon  


The project description document is an important part of the Hackathon as the teams will develop client ideas based on this information. Please include as many relevant information as possible.     

1.Company briefing     

La Pajita is a marketplace that wanted to join business with specialization in quality drinks with people that wanted a better experience when they go out for drinks

2.Project description 
The aim of this project is to develop a dynamic waiting list system to control the amount of people that they can attend properly.
The places that activate the waiting list will allow customers to subscribe to the list.
After subscribing to the list, the customer will now how many people is listed and the approximated time that it will take to its turn.
Customers can unsubscribe themselves from the list using the developed frontend. Business can remove customers from the view using the API (No frontend development is needed)

3. Objectives         
Develop frontend view and logic to handle the functionality
Develop backend logic and communication interface with frontend


4. Mockups         

5. Assets product owner will provide     
JSON containing Places information
JSON containing User Information
No database is needed. The data needed to test the waiting list could be stored as local variables in the backend

6. Technology needs       
Postman o similar applicacion to make api calls



--------------------------------------------


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
